RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0 Workbook
=========================

The examples in this directory are a compliment to the O'Reilly "RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0" book.

This book has a detailed explanation of REST and JAX-RS.

The appendix of the book also walks through all the example code provided within
this directory.

The author, Bill Burke, is the founder of the RESTEasy project.

UPDATE 2019-09-27:

Please note the `ex14_1` and `ex14_2` are removed because the examples are deprecated.

RESTEasy now has `resteasy-spring` module to support Springframework, and the `resteasy-spring-boot` project to support Spring Boot.

For the usage of `resteasy-spring`, please refer to the document: [RESTEasy_Spring_Integration](https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/current/userguide/html_single/index.html#RESTEasy_Spring_Integration)

For the usage of `resteasy-spring-boot`, please refer to the project README and sample applications: [RESTEasy Spring Boot Starter
